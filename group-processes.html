											<h3>How did we do in assignment 2?</h3>
											<p>As a group, people were able to get along well. Introductions went along smoothly and no friction ever developed among members. 
											All members held equal weight in the decision making of the group, 
											no de facto leaders were assigned and everyone was very much free to express opinions and ideas. 
											A messenger group was set up to provide everyone with a means of communication with one another. 
											This, along with the Google Drive and Github repository allowed for collaboration online outside the classroom.</p>
											
											<p>There were, however, some complications regarding consistency of communication at times. Groups members would become unreachable at times, both being offline and absent from classes. Due to some processes and tasks being a collaborative effort, some group members found themselves unable to progress due to having to wait on others to finish a designated task. </p>
											<p>That being said, the group was more than capable of completing the assingment in due time, to a satisfactory degree.</p>
											
											<h3>What improvements could be made?</h3>
											<p>Feedback recived from assignment 2 was valuble in organising assignment 3 to run smoother than before. 
											For example, the group's work will be shared and processed through the GitHub repository, as opposed to Google Drive. This way, progress can be monitored and managed all from the one location, both simplifing things and conforming to the assignment specifications of being able to comment on how well the audit trail reflects the group's work.</p>
											<p>Implementing organisational tools such as a gantt chart will also assist in the efficency of the group's work as task dependencies can be visualied. A gantt chart also allows deadlines to be set, and moved around if nessesary.</p>
