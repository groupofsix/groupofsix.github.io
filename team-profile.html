											<h3>Test Outcome Analysis</h3>
											
											
										
											<p>As a big group, the results to the three tests (Myer-Briggs, learning style and a test of each person’s choice) varied wildly.</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Frederica is ESFJ, this means she is outgoing, practical, likes social harmony, organised and assertive. She was found to be 35% an auditory learner, 35% a visual learner and 30% a tactile learner. Frederica also took a creativity test which she got a 57.03/100. This means she falls below average. </li>
													<li>Dylan is INFP, this means he is quieter and prefers to work in small groups with people he is comfortable with. This result also suggests he holds his personal values highly when making judgments and likes to understand the reasoning behind things. Dylan is a visual learner. Dylan took an Openness to Problem Solving Test. His result was an openness to creativity of 88, a high result. </li>
													<li>Meet is ENTP, this means he is extraverted, intuitive, thinking and prospecting. Meet is also a visual learner. Meet took a Big Five Personality Test. His results were 81st percentile for extroversion, 62nd percentile for emotional stability, 45th percentile for agreeableness, 76th percentile for conscientiousness and 70th percentile for intellect/imagination.</li>
													<li>Aakash is ISFP, this means, he is introverted, observant, feeling and prospecting. Aakash is a visual and auditory learner. Aakash took a Big Five Personality Test too. His results were 74th percentile for extroversion, 34th percentile for emotional stability, 76th percentile for agreeableness, 62nd percentile for conscientiousness and 3rd percentile for intellect/imagination.</li>
													<li>Barry too is ISFP, this means, like Aakash, he is introverted, observant, feeling and prospecting. However, his results were very neutral and fell in the centre of the scales. Barry is an auditory learner. Barry also took a Big Five Personality test. His results were 6th percentile for extroversion, 36th percentile for natural reactions, 55th percentile for agreeableness, 65th percentile for conscientiousness and 1st percentile for openness to experience. </li>
													
												</ul>
											<p>We are clearly all very different people which means we’ll all have to be very understanding that we all behave and learn in incredibly different manners. We will all need to be patient with each other. Our group balances well in terms of introverts vs extroverts which is positive. It should mean there isn’t turmoil in the group like there would be in a group full of extraverts and also that we do communicate which wouldn’t happen easily in a group full of introverts. We will all have to respect each other and the way we operate and find ways to cooperate despite our differences. </p>
